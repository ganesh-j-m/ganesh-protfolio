                <p> When I was in my first year, our college introduced an initiative called “Career Katta.”<br>
                    I participated in it, and I was selected as the Information & Communication Minister of <br>
                    our college for one year.Through this platform, we organized several activities and events<br>
                    that contributed to our overall personal and professional development. This experience <br>
                    sparked my interest in such initiatives and alongside my studies,<br>
                    I continued to take part in them.
